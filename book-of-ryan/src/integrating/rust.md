# Rust

To get ryan into your Rust project, just add the crate `ryan` with cargo:
```sh
cargo add ryan
```
Since Ryan is natively written in Rust, this crate is fully featured. In fact, this is the same crate used to create the Ryan CLI.

For information on how to use Ryan in Rust, see the [docs](https://docs.rs/ryan). All relevant details are explained in length there and it would not be expedient to just repeat everything in this tutorial.
